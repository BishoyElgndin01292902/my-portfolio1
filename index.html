            <p>I am a passionate computer programmer with a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. Outside of
                coding, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places,
                trying different cuisines while dining out, and reading books on various topics including programming
                and personal development. Sports are also a big part of my life,
                with a particular love for football and fishing, which help me unwind and stay active. Over the years,
                I’ve worked on several personal projects, honing my skills in
                programming and software development. I’ve continuously pushed myself to learn new technologies and
                improve my craft, with a goal of creating innovative solutions
                that make a positive impact in the world.</p>

                    <p>This project involves creating a College Registration Form that allows students to easily submit
                        their personal and academic details for enrollment.
                        The form collects essential information such as first name, last name, email, date of birth, and
                        address. It is equipped with validation features to
                        ensure that the entered data is accurate and complete, minimizing errors during the registration
                        process. The form includes user-friendly input fields and dropdowns for smoother data entry.
                        The design is clean and modern, with a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to mobile,
                        tablet, and desktop screens, ensuring accessibility across devices.
                        Additionally, the form features real-time error handling, guiding users through the process by
                        providing immediate feedback on any mistakes or missing fields.
